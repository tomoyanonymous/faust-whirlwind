# faust-whirlwind
Faust implementation of Meta-Wind-Instrument "Whirlwind" by Perry R. Cook in 1992.

Implementation is based on this paper [A meta wind instrument physical model and a meta controller](http://quod.lib.umich.edu/cgi/p/pod/dod-idx/meta-wind-instrument-physical-model-and-a-meta-controller.pdf?c=icmc;idno=bbp2372.1992.072).

Some meta parameters such as "mixing of lip resonater" is created for my own use.

This code is MIDI Control and Polyphony compatible with script such as faust2caqt ,faust2vsti or faust2juce.
